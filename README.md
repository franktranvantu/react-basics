React manages what gets rendered to the DOM. 

In order for this process to be fast and efficient, React needs a way to quickly know which items were changed, added, or removed. 

For this, React gives elements a special built-in prop named key. A key is a unique identifier that gives React a way to quickly and reliably identify an element in a list.
